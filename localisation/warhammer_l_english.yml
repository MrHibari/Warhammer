 auth_imp_desc:0 "Mankind has always excelled at the art of war, and the Emperor's armies are spread across the galaxy. The threat or effects of war are never far away, no matter where you go in the Imperium. Mankind seeks to purge the stars of its enemies, and the bloody carnage it wreaks in doing so shows no sign of abating. The Imperium's military is at once mighty, glorious and terrible. Some of the most important military forces of the Imperium include."

 auth_chaos_desc:0 "Chaos Space Marines, also sometimes called Traitor Marines, Renegade Marines, or Heretic Astartes, are former Loyalist Space Marines of the Imperium of Man who have chosen to abandon the service of the Emperor of Mankind and dedicate themselves to the service of Chaos to achieve their own ends."

 auth_darkeldar_desc:0 "A Kabal is a self-governing socio-economic paramilitary organization. Dark Eldar society is comprised primarily of these Kabals, as well as the Haemonculi Covens, the Incubus sect, and the Wych Cults. These Kabals send out raiding parties through Webway portals in order to collect alien beasts, slaves, and anything else the Kabal may need. The smallest Kabals may consist of hundreds of Dark Eldar, but their territories often consist of scattered hideouts and other secret locations. The largest Kabals contain millions of skilled soldiers."
 auth_ork:0 "Ork Clan"
 auth_ork_desc:0 "Ork Clans are cultural groupings of Orks rather than actual communities, each embodying a distinct Orkish philosophy. Clans exist outside the organization of tribes - where tribes are inconstant, breaking apart and reforming in war, Clans are constant and enduring."

 auth_tau_desc:0 "Each sept of the Tau Empire has its unique cultural identity wholly integrated within the greater Tau culture. This cultural identity seems to mainly derive from which Tau caste is more numerous and influential in the given sept. The Tau Empire was founded by the Tau caste called the Ethereals, who lead the Tau Empire in the name of the philosophy they have named the Greater Good."

The Senatorum is an Imperial governing body led by twelve leaders of the most powerful organisations of the Imperium. This body rules the Imperium in the Emperor's name.

The Imperium Secundus was eventually folded back into the larger Imperium before the end of the Horus Heresy in 014.M31. It was later considered by Guilliman one of his greatest mistakes and an event that he was not eager for others to learn of once he was resurrected to serve as Lord Commander of the Imperium after the birth of the Great Rift in the late 41st Millennium."

 civic_horde_traditions_desc:0 "Consummate horsemen and archers, these disparate tribes frequently fought one another for control of ancestral pastureland or - as their own ballads would have it - the sheer joy of battle. Chogorian armies had never invaded the Empty Quarter as the dry and desolate lands were of no value to the Palatine's people. However, the feudal nobles of the Palatine's state would often lead hunting bands into the steppes and take whole tribes east as slaves or capture a lone tribesmen to hunt through the mountains for sport."
 civic_barbarian_culture:0 "Barbarian Culture"
 civic_barbarian_culture_desc:0 "But the great lump of solid granite the Fenrisian tribesmen know as the polar continent of Asaheim always stands fast, a single, changeless continent on a world of fire, ice, ruin and torment. This extreme geography has resulted in the human population of Fenris becoming one composed largely of primitive, nomadic, barbarian tribes who barely approximate an Iron Age level of development. The tribes constantly seek secure territory, and as a result skirmishes and feuds over land between rival tribes are common. The Fenrisian people are hardened to the changes in temperature and environmental extremes, and so is the native fauna."

Though it seems to be a strange place to live, the people along its coast have been moulded into stronger and more resilient forms. The Time of Trial also brings great rewards. Rich veins of gems and metals are revealed, enough to be mined by the people to pay for livestock and food on the interplanetary market. Tradition is revered strongly of Nocturne, especially the tradition of smithing, as is evident by the presence of numerous 'Great Forges,' all across Nocturne."

 civic_production_guilds_desc:0 "The planet Kiavahr is populated by billions of workers and craftsmen, with huge fabrication plants and hive cities covering its surface. The planet's atmosphere is highly toxic from centuries of pollution and incidences of mutation are far higher than normal. This stretches the tolerance of the Adeptus Ministorum, but such is the quality and quantity of material that comes from the two worlds that more leeway is granted than would normally be the case."

 civic_interclans_rivalry_desc:0 "Ferrus was eventually adopted by the Medusan clans as one of their own.

 civic_tribal_culture_desc:0 "Millennia before the founding of the Imperium, Baal and its two moons were all but destroyed in a terrible war.

 civic_chivalric_traditions_desc:0 "The human inhabitants of Caliban were forced to live in huge fortresses and castles located in clearings hacked from the forests of the planet. Cut off from Terra and the rest of Mankind's interstellar community by the Warp Storms that savaged the galaxy during the Age of Strife, human civilisation on Caliban devolved into a semi-feudal state, with most of the population ruled over by a small warrior elite who were very similar in function and form to the medieval European knights of Old Earth's ancient past."
 civic_i:0 "I Legion"
 civic_i_desc:0 "The Dark Angels are considered amongst the most powerful and secretive of the Loyalist Space Marine Chapters. They were the Ist Legion of the original 20 Space Marine Legions to be created during the First Founding of the 30th Millennium. Though they claim complete allegiance and service to the Emperor of Mankind, their actions and secret goals at times seem at odds with that professed loyalty, as the Dark Angels strive above all other things to atone for an ancient crime of betrayal committed over 10,000 standard years ago against the trust of the Emperor during the time of the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. The Dark Angels stand first amongst the Space Marine Chapters, as they have done since their very inception as the Ist Legion. They are a proud Chapter, with traditions and rituals that date back to the earliest days of the Imperium of Man."
 civic_xiii:0 "XIII Legion"
 civic_xiii_desc:0 "The Ultramarines are considered one of the strongest and most honoured of all the Space Marine Chapters in the Imperium of Man, and were responsible for almost single-handedly holding the Imperium together after the Horus Heresy. Highly disciplined and courageous warriors, the Ultramarines have remained true to the teachings of their Primarch Roboute Guilliman for 10,000 standard years. The Ultramarines were originally the XIII Space Marine Legion before the reforms that initiated the Second Founding and reshaped the Imperium after the Heresy on the orders of Guilliman himself. The name 'Ultramarines' is a nod to both the Chapter's standing amongst the other Space Marine Chapters and their role as the source for the gene-seed of more Chapters of Astartes than any of the other former First Founding Legions combined."
 civic_ix:0 "IX Legion"
 civic_ix_desc:0 "The Blood Angels are one of the 20 First Founding Legions of the Space Marines and were originally the IXth Legion before the Second Founding broke the Legiones Astartes up into separate Chapters of 1000 Space Marines. They are well-known across the galaxy for their bloodthirsty nature in battle, and feared for the curse of flawed gene-seed they carry. The Blood Angels are amongst the longest-living of the Adeptus Astartes, with some of the Chapter's Space Marines having served the Emperor of Mankind for over a thousand standard years. Due to recent events, the Blood Angels' numbers were severely depleted. Under the threat of extinction, and in order to quickly replenish their numbers, the Blood Angels were forced to ask their kindred Successor Chapters from subsequent Astartes Foundings for a tithe of warriors from the related Chapters' pools of Neophytes, their candidate Space Marines."
 civic_x:0 "X Legion"
 civic_x_desc:0 "The Iron Hands are a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter and one of the original First Founding Space Marine Legions created from the gene-seed of their martyred Primarch, Ferrus Manus. Like the other Loyalist Astartes Legions, the Iron Hands would later be divided up after the Horus Heresy into multiple different Chapters, as required by the Codex Astartes, although one Chapter of the original Legion remained known as the Iron Hands and is described below. Although unwavering in their faith in the Emperor of Mankind and His dream of human unity as embodied in the Imperium of Man, the Iron Hands also believe that human flesh is weak and easily corruptible, and strive to replace their organic bodies with more 'pure' bionic substitutes, thus closely emulating the faith of the Adeptus Mechanicus' Cult of the Machine."
 civic_vii:0 "VII Legion"
 civic_vii_desc:0 "The Imperial Fists are one of the First Founding Chapters of the Space Marines and were originally the VII Legion of the Legiones Astartes raised by the Emperor Himself from across Terra during the Unification Wars. The Imperial Fists stand out from other Space Marine Chapters since they possess no fixed homeworld, although they are most frequently based on Terra. Instead, the Imperial Fists rely on their 10,000-year-old mobile space fortress, Phalanx, to serve as their fortress-monastery. They maintain recruitment-chapels on various worlds spread throughout the Imperium. Part of the Imperial Fists' duties during the Great Crusade were to function as the Emperor's 'personal praetorians', accompanying Him everywhere. The Imperial Fists were usually used to strike a decisive blow against the enemies He confronted during that time. The role of the Emperor's bodyguards since he was mortally wounded during the Horus Heresy and interred within the Golden Throne at the heart of the Imperial Palace on Terra has now been entirely taken over by the Adeptus Custodes."
 civic_xviii:0 "XVIII Legion"
 civic_xviii_desc:0 "The Salamanders are one of the Loyalist First Founding Chapters of Space Marines. They originally served as the Imperium's XVIII Space Marine Legion during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy and for some time before the return of their Primarch were known as the 'Dragon Warriors'. Their homeworld is the volcanic Death World of Nocturne. The Salamanders as a Chapter are unusually concerned with civilian casualties compared to most other Space Marines and believe that one of their most important duties is to protect the lives of the Emperor of Mankind's innocent subjects whenever and wherever possible. This is an attitude that developed as a consequence of the Salamanders' own unusually close connections to the Nocturnean people, as they are one of the only Chapters of Astartes who continue to interact with their families and the people of their homeworld after their transformation into Space Marines."
 civic_xix:0 "XIX Legion"
 civic_xix_desc:0 "The Raven Guard is one of the original First Founding Chapters of the Space Marines and was originally the XIXth Space Marine Legion before the Second Founding and the adoption of the Codex Astartes. Named for a Terran avian seen by many cultures as the herald of fate and messenger of death, the Raven Guard have served the Emperor faithfully throughout the glories of the Unification Wars, the Great Crusade and the dark days of the Horus Heresy and beyond. From its earliest days, the warriors of the XIXth Legion were known as cunning and patient hunters, adept at biding their time until the moment to strike was at hand. When the Legion was united with its Primarch - Corvus Corax, the Raven Lord, the Deliverer, theirs was a form of warfare exemplifying speed, stealth and precision which was codified into their doctrine, and under the ivory-skinned, shadow-eyed and sable-haired Primarch, the XIXth Legion carved its name in the annals of the Great Crusade."
 civic_v:0 "V Legion"
 civic_v_desc:0 "The White Scars, who call themselves the 'Horde of Jaghatai' and were originally called the Star Hunters during the early Great Crusade, are a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter and one of the First Founding Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes. Known and feared throughout the Imperium of Man for their highly mobile way of war, the White Scars are considered the masters of the lightning strike and hit-and-run attack and are particularly adapted to the use of the Astartes Assault Bike as their mechanical steeds and their forces contain an unusually large number of Bike Squads compared to other Chapters. Bearing the ritual scars of bravery, these fierce warriors fight with all the tribal savagery that define the fierce steppe nomads of their homeworld Mundus Planus, known to them as Chogoris, bringing swift death to all of the enemies of the Imperium."
 civic_vi:0 "VI Legion"
 civic_vi_desc:0 "The Space Wolves, known in their own dialect of Juvjk as the Vlka Fenryka or 'Wolves of Fenris', are one of the original 20 First Founding Space Marine Chapters, and were once led by their famed Primarch, Leman Russ. Originally the VI Legion of Astartes raised by the Emperor at the dawn of the Great Crusade, the Space Wolves are renowned for their anti-authoritarian ways and their embrace of their homeworld Fenris' savage barbarian culture as well as their extreme deviation from the Codex Astartes in the Chapter's organisation. After the Horus Heresy and the resultant Second Founding reforms of the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Wolves Legion was divided into two Chapters: the new Space Wolves Chapter, which was not compliant with the dictates of the Codex Astartes and retained the name of its parent Legion, and the second Chapter which took the name of the Wolf Brothers. The Wolf Brothers suffered from rampant mutation of their gene-seed not long after their Founding and were later disbanded. It is currently unknown if there are any other Successor Chapters of the Space Wolves in the Imperium."
 civic_khorne_cult:0 "Khorne Cult"
 civic_khorne_cult_desc:0 "Khorne is the violent, angry, and murderous God of Chaos. His creed of mindless, wanton destruction appeals only to the utterly psychotic and violent, which take to the battlefield with the unabashed urge to kill, burn, and maim. Because this overt behaviour makes them so noticeable, Khorne’s cultists are chased to the far fringes of the Empire, where the powers of Chaos can hold greater sway over the populace than the local governments. Organised cults dedicated to Khorne can only successfully operate where there are no real laws. The head of the cult is invariably an extremely powerful, merciless individual who goads his minions into battle with promises of blood and gore. The cults must behave like sharks — they must be constantly on the move, killing whenever possible. Cults of Khorne that cannot find enough innocents to massacre turn upon themselves in short order, both to sate the desires of their foul god and to appease its members’ own lust for death and chaos."
 civic_tzeentch_cult:0 "Tzeentch Cult"
 civic_tzeentch_cult_desc:0 "Those who follow the teachings of Tzeentch are dedicated to change in all its forms. They are the most mystical of the Chaos cults, seeking out forbidden knowledge regardless of the cost it exacts on the mind, body, and spirit. Hedge wizards, ex-priests, and those who dabble in the occult are the most likely candidates to be drawn into a cult of Tzeentch. The Colleges of Magic are constantly on the hunt for Cults of Tzeentch, viewing them as horrid aberrations that meddle in things that should be left alone. The Colleges engage in constant pogroms within their membership, rooting out those who have fallen sway to Tzeentch’s control. Although they are never spoken of, these fallen brethren are all too common. Magic is intrinsically tied to Chaos, and its practitioners are more vulnerable to the call of entropy and corruption than the average citizen of the Empire."
 civic_nurgle_cult:0 "Nurgle Cult"
 civic_nurgle_cult_desc:0 "Disease is an all too common aspect of life in the Empire. Many people live their entire lives suffering from one ailment or another, and almost every household has lost at least one immediate family member to a horrific illness. The cult of Nurgle preys on those who succumb to the grief and despair that result from this ever present disease and decay. In their madness, they come to believe that Nurgle offers some form of salvation or understanding of pestilence and the entropy of the world. Few realise their misguided convictions only fuel Nurgle’s power, creating a never-ending cycle of disease and despair. Cults of Nurgle recruit members from those suffering from horrible afflictions, nihilists, and those driven insane from disease or despair. Nurgle drives them to wander the Old World, spreading pestilence wherever they go. While most cultists eventually succumb to the numerous diseases they carry, a few become strangely energised by their afflictions, mutating into disgusting forms. Cultists of Nurgle are also remarkably cheery — Nurgle is seen as a 'loving' god who teaches his followers to accept the diseases that mar their body as a sign of his approval and grace."
 civic_slaanesh_cult:0 "Slaanesh Cult"
 civic_slaanesh_cult_desc:0 "Easily the most insidious and subtle of the Chaos cults, followers of Slaanesh are dedicated to serving their God through the subversion and corruption of others. Cultists are wanton hedonists who seek stranger and more perverse delights to shock their jaded senses into some kind of reaction. Over time, cultists lose all sense of morality or scruples, turning to murder and vile debauchery in the name of Slaanesh, the God of Pleasure. The cult of Slaanesh strives to insinuate itself in all levels of society. It is popular among the upper classes, the members of which often do not know exactly what it is that they are worshipping. In their quest for pleasurable moments, these misguided folk find amusement and novelty in paying homage to strange, seductive idols or partaking in debauched gatherings behind closed doors. Artists, poets, and other seekers of sensual things are often drawn to Slaanesh’s cults. Of them all, the cult of Slaanesh is probably the hardest to uproot, as the political fallout of revealing such heresy could topple the entire Empire."
 civic_malice_cult:0 "Malice Cult"
 civic_malice_cult_desc:0 "Followers of Malice are prone to acts of anarchy, waging war upon not only the servants of the Imperium but also those of the other Gods of Chaos by unleashing their wrath. Captives are routinely ritually sacrificed. Unlike the primary Chaos Gods, Malice can be summoned directly to the Materium provided enough mortal sacrifices are given and he is given a body to Daemonically possess."
 civic_chaos_undivided:0 "Chaos Undivided"
 civic_chaos_undivided_desc:0 "Followers of Chaos Undivided venerate the force of Chaos itself, seeing the four major Chaos Gods as a single pantheon to be worshipped equally as different emanations of the same universal force. Of all the worshippers of Chaos they follow Chaos in its purest form. They can interpret the meaning of Chaos in a variety of ways, including as a single god, worship the four major Chaos Gods equally, or favour one slightly over the others. The Chaos Lords and Daemon Princes of Chaos Undivided are at an advantage in their ability to unite any of the forces of Chaos under their leadership, even if they would normally worship opposing gods like Khorne and Slaanesh, so the warbands of Chaos Undivided are always the most diverse."
 civic_iii:0 "III Legion"
 civic_iii_desc:0 "The Emperor's Children, also sometimes known after their fall as the Lords of Profligacy, are a Traitor Legion of Chaos Space Marines who devote themselves solely to the service of the Chaos God Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure, though they were originally the Imperium of Man's proud IIIrd Legion of Astartes. The Emperor's Children was the only Space Marine Legion to bear the Emperor's own name and His own icon - the Palatine Aquila - granted to them by His hand as a symbol of the Legion's martial perfection. Few were ever so honoured amongst the ancient Space Marine Legions and given less cause to betray the Master of Mankind than the Emperor's Children. Given the plaudits and accolades accorded them, few could doubt that they were the embodiment of what the Emperor had intended the Legiones Astartes to be: noble in action and aspect, excelling in all matters, strong, civilised, firm of purpose and loyal to the core."
 civic_iv:0 "IV Legion"
 civic_iv_desc:0 "The Iron Warriors are one of the nine First Founding Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines that turned to the service of Chaos during the Horus Heresy and now fight to overthrow the Imperium of Man. The Iron Warriors, who were originally the IVth Legion of Space Marines, specialized in the breaking of sieges and assaults on static fortifications, which made them great rivals of the Imperial Fists Legion, said to construct the greatest static defenses in the Imperium. It was this rivalry between the Legions, and between their Primarchs Perturabo and the Imperial Fists' Rogal Dorn, that helped turn the Iron Warriors to Chaos. Like the members of the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Loyalist Iron Hands Chapter, the Iron Warriors have a strong predilection for replacing parts of their body with cybernetic enhancements. When struck with a mutational 'gift' from the Ruinous Powers, most Iron Warriors simply cut off the mutated appendage, if possible, and replace it with a mechanical one."
 civic_xv:0 "XV Legion"
 civic_xv_desc:0 "The Thousand Sons are one of the Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines who are sworn solely to the service of Tzeentch, the Chaos God of Change, Intrigue and Sorcery, though they were once the Imperium of Man's XV Legion of Space Marines. The main feature that distinguishes the Thousand Sons from the other Traitor Legions is the sheer number of psyker mutations that have always existed amongst the Space Marines in this Legion. Every current member of the Legion possesses psychic abilities and they prefer to use Chaos Sorcerers and guile in combat, relying on their psychic powers and sorcerous knowledge to earn them victory. As a result of an ancient spell known as the Rubric of Ahriman that was cast soon after the Thousand Sons fell from their homeworld of Prospero during the early days of the Horus Heresy, every Thousand Sons Astartes that lacked psychic powers had his soul fused directly into his Power Armour. The Thousand Sons have become living embodiments of sorcery animated by the power of Chaos and the will of the Lord of Change."
 civic_xiv:0 "XIV Legion"
 civic_xiv_desc:0 "The Death Guard are one of the Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines. They worship and devote themselves exclusively to the Chaos God Nurgle and as a result of his mutational 'gifts' they have become Plague Marines; Astartes who are eternally rotting away within their Power Armor and infected with every known form of disease and decay but who are immune to all pain or minor injury. When the XIVth Legion was first raised on Terra by the Emperor during the First Founding, its Astartes were known as the Dusk Raiders. After the XIVth Legion was reunited with its Primarch Mortarion on the world of Barbarus, he renamed the Legion the Death Guard. The Death Guard are a Traitor Legion entirely steeped in the power of Nurgle, the god of death and plagues, their very essence the epitome of all that vile Chaos God stands for. Their bodies are hives of filth and decay, their ﬂesh eternally rotting away even as it is renewed by the ceaseless process of death and rebirth."
 civic_xvii:0 "XVII Legion"
 civic_xvii_desc:0 "The Word Bearers are one of the nine First Founding Space Marine Legions that betrayed the Emperor of Mankind during the Horus Heresy. They became Chaos Space Marines, their allegiance pledged to their Daemon Primarch Lorgar and to Chaos Undivided. The Word Bearers were also the first Space Marine Legion to be corrupted by the Ruinous Powers of Chaos many Terran decades before their counterparts turned to the Dark Gods. Through their actions they corrupted the Warmaster Horus and brought on the terrible galactic civil war of the Horus Heresy in all its savagery. Today they bend all their considerable efforts towards the overthrow of the 'Corpse Emperor' in the Long War and spreading the 'truth' of Chaos to all Mankind."
 civic_xii:0 "XII Legion"
 civic_xii_desc:0 "The World Eaters are one of the Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines who now inhabit the Warp rift known as the Eye of Terror in the Imperium of Man's Segmentum Obscurus. The World Eaters, originally known as the War Hounds, were also once the XIIth Legion of the twenty First Founding Space Marine Legions, and one of the first to betray the Emperor of Mankind for the service of Chaos and the Warmaster Horus. This Legion was a collection of nearly inhuman monsters long before Horus became corrupted and monsters they would remain, only with what little remained of their restraint and their humanity stripped away after their fall to Chaos."
 civic_xvi:0 "XVI Legion"
 civic_xvi_desc:0 "The Black Legion is a Traitor Legion of Chaos Space Marines that is the first in infamy, if not in treachery, whose name resounds as a curse throughout the scattered and war-torn realms of humanity. The Black Legion was once one of the 9 First Founding Legions of Space Marines who turned Traitor to the Imperium during the Horus Heresy in the early 31st Millennium. The Black Legion, at that time still known as the Sons of Horus, became the primary instrument of its Primarch, the Warmaster Horus, to overthrow the Emperor of Mankind and seize control of the Imperium in the name of Chaos. Such are the crimes of the Black Legion that it is easy to forget that the past was very different, and that there was a time when its Astartes and their perfidious master Horus were lauded above all of the other warriors of the Legiones Astartes, and were considered the most favoured servants of the Emperor of Mankind."
 civic_xx:0 "XX Legion"
 civic_xx_desc:0 "The Alpha Legion is the Chaos Space Marine Traitor Legion about whom the least is known. The Alpha Legion was once the XXth Legion of Astartes created during the First Founding by the Emperor of Mankind to carry out His Great Crusade to reunite all of humanity in a new golden age under His rule. They are experts in infiltration, covert operations, misdirection and diversion tactics, and their armies contain many Chaos Cultists and other mortal agents in addition to regular Heretic Astartes. The Alpha Legion's Primarch was named Alpharius, and was actually one of the identical twin Primarchs Alpharius Omegon, two brilliant and secretive sons of the Emperor, one of whom was reportedly later killed after the end of the Horus Heresy by Roboute Guilliman, the Primarch of the Ultramarines. Despite its seeming allegiance to Chaos, a closer scrutiny of the Alpha Legion's known history indicates that their seeming service to Chaos Undivided might actually be the greatest deception they have played upon the Imperium."

 civic_viii_desc:0 "The Night Lords were originally the VIIIth Legion of Space Marines created during the First Founding and became one of the 9 Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines that betrayed the Emperor of Mankind during the Horus Heresy of the 31st Millennium. They do not worship any of the four Chaos Gods individually, but acknowledge them equally in the form of Chaos Undivided as they ruthlessly spread terror and fear amongst the galaxy's inhabitants. The Night Lords are experts in the use of terror tactics to win battles and demoralise their foes before the main combat even begins. The Night Lords are synonymous with terror and murder, for their favoured mode of warfare is the unfettered application of brutal, overwhelming force. They show no mercy whatsoever, eschewing all subtlety and guile for wanton bloodshed and destruction. While such an approach might appear mindless, at one time it was different."

The Red Corsairs were once a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter called the Astral Claws who were based on the world of Badab Primaris in the Badab Sector of the Ultima Segmentum. The Astral Claws were, ironically, raised during the 10th Founding in the 35th Millennium to guard against the numerous daemonic and alien threats emerging from the Maelstrom. Under the leadership of their Chapter Master, Lufgt Huron, the 'Tyrant of Badab', in the late 41st Millennium, the Astral Claws sought to have the Badab Sector secede from the Imperium of Man. This was in protest against the Imperium's continued attempts to use the resources of the Badab Sector outside the region to fill the pockets of greedy Imperial merchants and manufactoria rather than dedicating them fully to the defeat of the Chaos and xenos threats that menaced the Maelstrom Zone."

They were convinced that they no longer had anything to fear from the galaxy at large, and they may have been right, but the real danger came from within. For those Aeldari who yet survive, war is their only hope. Their foes - both new and old - lack the technology, wisdom and skill of the Children of the Stars; in numbers alone are their enemies insurmountable.

Indeed, when they do retreat, Blood Axes will in fact return with larger numbers. They trade with humans for wargear and vehicles, and have even worked as mercenaries for the Imperium at times (such as during the Massacre at Big Toof River). All of these things lead followers of other klanz to brand them as dangerously treacherous, cowardly, and downright un-Orky! Most Blood Axes are back-stabbing 'Kommandoz', essentially serving as Ork special operations troops. Blood Axes wear combat fatigues and forage caps in shades of green and drab colours, commonly in camouflage patterns.

The Sept has also seen many infamous Ork invasions, though its warriors have defeated each in turn, despite the horrors wrought by the greenskins.

D'yanoi inhabit a tidally-locked orbit, and interaction between this trait and the revolutions of its moons leaves the planet bathed in a constant twilight.

Due to their use of the galaxy-spanning inter-dimensional labyrinth known as the Webway, they are extremely mobile, striking from seemingly nowhere, with little or no warning, and vanishing with their captives before significant military reaction can be mobilised.

Originally famous for their pain-farms and a talent for keeping captives alive indefinitely, their ability to drain a victim of every last drop of pain for their clients has led them to infamy.

Although they resort to piracy to survive due to lacking a economic support structure like a Craftworld or Kabal, it is mainly motivated by the fact that without the War Mask taught through the Path of the Warrior, Eldar can easily get addicted to the pleasures of battle and killing.

They make common use of slave-soldiers as cannon fodder to wither the ammunition supplies of the besieged and to locate the positions of enemy gun emplacements. And, like the Iron Hands they use bionics often to replace mutated limbs, as they hate all forms of mutation.Finally, traitor Titans are known to work with the Iron Warriors to such an extent that some believe that they are in fact now part of the Legion."

After their defeat at the Horus' Heresy, the Night Lords eventually fragmented into disparate warbands largely built around their original legion company structure and relocated to the Eye of Terror. The legion follows the philosophy of terror, as they had inspire obedience to the law by fear of extreme punishment. This societal philosophy translated into the military tactics of swift, sudden and decisive strikes often carried out to excess, as well as making sure the enemy knew who had hit them."

They lead a vast fleet of pirates composed of mortals and other Traitor Marines that threaten Imperial shipping and Imperial worlds near the Maelstrom Warp, This fleet is capable to deploy small, elite forces of renegade space marines supported by larger groups of human reavers.

Specialized at psychic combat, after the heresy the Legion went through a crisis of mutation and de-evolution, seemingly at the wish of their patron-God, Tzeentch. At at this development, their chief sorcerer, Ahriman, cast a powerful spell designed to render the Thousand Sons immune to the warping effects of Chaos. While the spell succeeded in this goal, it had an unforseen consequence of transforming the mutated Thousand Sons into little more than mystically animated suits of armor barely capable of being termed as anything more sentient than automata."

 building_auditorium_desc:0 "Most Imperial cities have at least one auditorium, where the populace assemble at great rallies organised by the Administratum and the Inquisition. A visiting dignitary, such as an Inquisitor or a Space Marine commander, will often be requested to lead such a rally. It is common practise to use the main auditorium - if it still stands - to announce the 'liberation' of a city by one side or the other."

 building_castra_exercitus_desc:0 "According to the provisions of the Codex Exercitus, every Imperial world has a duty to raise and maintain its own Planetary Defence Force. Additionally, each city or world forms part of a precinct where Imperial laws are enforced by the Judges of the Adeptus Arbites. One or more barracks will be found in most Imperial cities, providing accommodation, training areas and armouries for the forces they house. Much fighting has centred around these strongholds."

 building_librarium:0 "Librarium"
 building_librarium_desc:0 "During the terrible wars of the Age of Strife, untold quantities of knowledge were lost, and preserving that which remains has become a holy task shared by the Administratum and the Adeptus Mechanicus.

 building_manufactorium:0 "Manufactorium"
 building_manufactorium_desc:0 "Although much technology was lost during the fifteen centuries of the Age of Strife, the Imperium is by no means technically backward. Industrial complexes across the galaxy produce billions of items, from clothing to plasma bombs. All of these installations are closely controlled by the Administratum and the Adeptus Mechanicus, and it is not uncommon for the workers in a factory to be completely unaware of the end-product of their labours. The occupation or destruction of the manufactorium or industrial complex can deny precious resources to the enemy."

 building_mausoleum_desc:0 "For the vast bulk of the citizens of the Imperium, death is not the end of their service to the Emperor. They are quickly forgotten by everyone except the record-keepers of the Administratum and their bodies are recycled into foodstuffs, fertilisers, and other useful products. More prominent members of society may receive the honour of entombment in an Imperial mausoleum, where the masses may read of their deeds and be inspired by their example. With its halls of entombed heroes, a Mausoleum can become the focus of a fanatical defence, and its destruction can deal a severe blow to the defenders' morale."

They are usually distinguished by the sign of the Imperial Aquila over the main door. Many bloody assaults and valiant defences have taken place in and around urban and planetary government buildings; they are natural command points, and the fall of the Administratum normally indicates the fall of the city. This building is often an attacker's primary target."
 building_censorium:0 "Censorium"
 building_censorium_desc:0 "Countless clerks and officials labour on a million worlds for the Administratum, most of them confined to dark offices in grim, towering administrative blocks. These buildings house vast quantities of information on their worlds; population, economy, levels of production and taxation, resources, industrial and agricultural quotas - the whole of the world is recorded, filed, indexed and updated by an army of bureaucrats. The valuable data in a Censorium can make it a prime target."

Raised next to the walkways of cities skyscrapers, automatic Confession Machines are programmed to detect every dark thought, scanning Imperial citizen for mutation and corruption within. If the victim inside is found guilty, the adamantium gate closes and furnace fire begins to rage - few seconds later ashes are scattered by vents on top, and gate opens welcoming next law abiding citizen..."

 building_confessorum_desc:0 "When population of hive city is undoubtfully tainted by powers of Chaos, the Ecclesiarch calls to create Hive Confessorums - places of mandatory admission, where civilians are fetched in by law enforcers. A generator-like structure, prepared by Mech-priests to fit several Confession machines, automatically checks the level of guilt and mutation in citizens. When the level is too high, adamantium gate closes and engines begins to roar as flames encompass screaming victim. In some deserted cities, these places of execution still possess bones of the heretics inside, forever caged inside the machine which decided about their guilt."

This guillotines are widely spread among squares and in front of cathedrals. Once the execution is announced through the speakers around the city, citizens gather to hear the crimes of convict.

 building_generatorum:0 "Generatorum"
 building_generatorum_desc:0 "Each passing day, citizens gather in the early hours of the morning to work in Cog-Father facilities, fuelling the imperial economy. The Generatorums are most common of those factories, with reactors strong enough to provide power for skyscrapers standing next to them. If the hive world is attacked, these facilities provide much needed energy to fuel tanks or even titans."
 building_cellarion:0 "Cellarion"
 building_cellarion_desc:0 "No world is an island within the Imperium; each gains something from the rest of the galaxy, and each must pay its way. The worlds of the Imperium provide foodstuffs, machinery, minerals and many other things according to their resources.

The culminating point in their march is where Imperial Triumphal Arch is erected. On its walls are inscribed names of Crusade's heroes - ones who sacrificed their life in the service of Imperium.

As the weapon heats up the eyes that adorn the weapon begin to weep tears of excess molten slag. This slag sticks to targets more readily, doing more damage over time, but the wrapping makes the weapon overheat faster."
 r_maelstromcleaver:0 "Maelstrom Cleaver"
 r_maelstromcleaver_desc:0 "The axe is a favoured weapon for many who serve Chaos, and those who wield sorcerous powers, in the name of their dark Gods, are no exception. The thin blade makes the weapon less effective for blocking and defense, leaving the Sorcerer more vulnerable against melee opponents."
 r_rage_spitter:0 "Rage Spitter"
 r_rage_spitter_desc:0 "Rage Spitters are Bolt Guns used primarily by Aspiring Champions, within the Black Legion. They mark the Chaos Space Marines who wield them, as ones to watch within the ranks of Chaos; for only the most forward thinking, and determined power-seekers are rewarded with these weapons for their dedicated (and often brutal) service to Abaddon."
 r_shrieking_souls_armor:0 "Shrieking Souls Armor"
 r_shrieking_souls_armor_desc:0 "The Armour of Shrieking Souls is the daemonic power armour worn by Lucius the Eternal. It is alive with the souls he has stolen over the thousands of years he has been preying on his enemies. The souls are in permanent anguish and are used to protect the armour from damage, but they can also be released in a wave of psychic anguish to assault his enemies."
 r_widowmaker_bolter:0 "Widowmaker Bolter"
 r_widowmaker_bolter_desc:0 "The Night Lords excel at causing terror and fear in their foes, and the Widowmaker bolter comes from that mindset with effective screaming ammunition designed to destroy morale and rout enemies. Though first made popular by the Night Lords, the ammunition (and the weapon design) have been made available to all those who serve in Abaddon’s black crusade."
 #
 r_firesabre:0 "Firesabre"
 r_firesabre_desc:0 "The Firesabre is an Eldar artifact. Many legends speak of the Draoch-var, a great drake whose fires reduces the great forests of Velorn to ash, and who toppled the pillars of the temple of Isha. The Firesabre is said to have been forged from Draoch's razored fangs in celebration of Ulthanesh's victory over the creature. It burns with a fury that can never be quenched, and its fire spreads like a living thing."
 r_fire_dragon_fusion_gun:0 "Fire Dragon Fusion Gun"
 r_fire_dragon_fusion_gun_desc:0 "The Fusion Gun is a melta weapon developed by the Eldar and commonly used by the Fire Dragon Aspect Warriors, as well as Storm Guardian units. This powerful weapon has a short range, but is capable of reducing an enemy battle tank to a pile of molten slag or vaporize an enemy soldier in under a second."
 r_swoopinghawk_lasblaster:0 "Swoopinghawk Lasblaster"
 r_swoopinghawk_lasblaster_desc:0 "The Lasblaster is an Aeldari Laser Weapon utilised exclusively by Swooping Hawks Aspect Warriors. Aeldari lasers use psychically grown crystals to refine their already intense bursts to their optimum potency."
 r_gatekeepers_bastion:0 "Gatekeepers Bastion"
 r_gatekeepers_bastion_desc:0 "Eldar deploy into a variety of climates, across countless worlds. The Gatekeeper modifications to the standard Dire Avenger Shuriken Catapult are made with fortification and protection against environmental conditions in mind. The model includes reinforced casing around the barrel and magazine, and an augmented scope/range finder built with penetrating hostile planetary conditions as its primary function (snow storms, sand storms, etc.)"
 r_gorhu_armor:0 "Gorhu Armor"
 r_gorhu_armor_desc:0 "An armor worn by Gorhu, considered a renegade by his fellow Eldar in ancient times, seemingly cursed to always bear discord, misery, and confusion in his wake. Gorhu’s miraculous armour was believed to be the cause of this. His armour, many said, was a cursed thing, created by a Chaos power. At first, Gorhu delighted in the magical armour he found, for while he wore it he could not be slain by any force. His companions soon noticed, however, that Gorhu was incapable of learning even the simplest thing or gaining any wisdom as long as he wore the armour. Indeed, as time passed, he actually seemed to lose what meager skills he began his career with. Thus Gorhu, who at one time was a being of great acclaim, slowly descended into madness. He eventually took flight from his fellows, never to be seen again."
 r_ice_hawk_cannon:0 "Ice Hawk Cannon"
 r_ice_hawk_cannon_desc:0 "While large parts of Arkhona are habitable, red earth, with a temperate climate; significant parts of Arkhona retain the planets former Ice World climate and environment. In an effort to provide some level of camouflage in this environment, the Bonesingers of Craftworld Biel-Tan have developed the Ice Hawk pattern weapons; weapons that have been designed with a shifting appearance designed to blend and fit into a snowy, tundra terrain."
 r_laelshanwitchblade:0 "Lael'shan Witchblade"
 r_laelshanwitchblade_desc:0 "Death means something different to the Eldar—a dying race on the precipice of destruction. For some, it becomes an obsession; one that can be dangerously consuming.The blades of these weapons turn completely black over time. No one can quite explain why or how they transform, but the most common theory amongst the Bonesingers is that they are coloured by the psychic energy of their wielder; a sympathetic, empathic reaction to the darkness their wielder struggles against."
 r_last_runes_armor:0 "Last Runes Armor"
 r_last_runes_armor_desc:0 "The Armour of the Last Runes is a powerful suit of Eldrad Ulthran. It consist of breastplate with the runic scripts and powerful wards that protect this Eldar hero from harm. Those who schooled in deciphering Eldar runes would see they speak of enduring until the final dying of the light."
 r_maeldannan_diresword:0 "Maeldannan Diresword"
 r_maeldannan_diresword_desc:0 "The Dire Avengers aspect typifies Khaela Mensha Kaine’s complete lack of mercy for his enemies. Renowned for their use of the Avenger Shuriken Catapult, some aspect warriors prefer to focus on melee combat above all, and arm themselves accordingly. Like all Direswords, the spirit contained with the Mael Dannan blade will attempt to instantly kill any foe struck."
 r_torrent_reaper_launcher:0 "Torrent Reaper Launcher"
 r_torrent_reaper_launcher_desc:0 "The Torrent Dark Reaper Launcher makes use of a cylindrical drum for magazine-style loading of rapid-fire mini missiles. Increasing the ammo capacity of the standard reaper launcher significantly, but the added ammunition increases the weight of the weapon as well, despite the addition of anti-grav devices."
 r_vyper:0 "Vyper"
 r_vyper_desc:0 "The Vyper is a highly mobile weapon platform based on an enlarged Jetbike design. A military innovation initially pioneered by the artisans of Saim-Hann, Vypers are two-seater, anti-gravitic attack craft capable of mounting a variety of heavy weapons."
 #
 r_boss_choppa:0 "Boss Choppa"
 r_boss_choppa_desc:0 "Choppa is a term applied to a multitude of basic Ork close-combat weapons. This category of weapon consists of a bewildering variety of bladed, spiked, serrated, jagged, barbed, and notched hand weapons, ranging from the proverbial blunt instrument to whirring two-handed, Ork-tooth Chainaxes known as Big Choppas."
 r_da_heart_stoppa:0 "Da Heart Stoppa"
 r_da_heart_stoppa_desc:0 "Imperial reports have sighted these weapons at an increasing rate skirmishes with Ork attackers. Adeptus examinations of captured weapons indicate there is no feasible way the weapon should work… however, one cannot ignore the effective of this seeming piece of roughly assembled junk in the hands of an Ork. Scavenged from the parts of Imperial and possibly Tau weaponry, the 'Heart stoppa' (as the Orks have designated it) is essentially a heavily customized Lascannon."
 r_daneedleuvlif:0 "Da Needle Uv Lif"
 r_daneedleuvlif_desc:0 "The savage greenskins have only a rudimentary knowledge of most things, including medicine. Standard Ork 'Medics' rely on some strange chemical secretion that is injected during combat, but their reliance on extensively and heavy machine parts often makes reaching the actual injured Ork difficult. Having seen this tool deployed in the field, it functions essentially like an Astartes Narthecium, with a powerful mechanical drill for opening damaged armour."
 r_heresy_limited_edition_looted_umie_bolter:0 "Heresy Limited Edition Looted Umie Bolter"
 r_heresy_limited_edition_looted_umie_bolter_desc:0 "Looted 'Umie Bolter are Bolters stripped from the corpses of Space Marines and re-purposed for use by the Orks. Though Orks may not be able to commune with these divine weapons the way a Space Marine can, they are no less lethal in their hands. The loss of such a treasure to the Greenskins is intolerable to Space Marines and they considered it their duty to recover these stolen weapons."
 r_iron_sight_shoota:0 "Iron Sight Shoota"
 r_iron_sight_shoota_desc:0 "With this weapon, the Orks appear to be utilizing tracer round technology. Extremely rapid fire, even for an Ork weapon, but their accuracy seems to be markedly improved by red tracer ammunition. The Ordo Xenos has launched an inquiry into whether or not these are some sort of sorcerous ammunition rounds. The capture of one of these weapons has been authourised and approved. They can be located easily on the battle field by their more metallic sound they make, lower pitched and with more echo than standard Ork weapons."
 r_looted_power_armor:0 "Looted Power Armor"
 r_looted_power_armor_desc:0 "Looted 'Umie Power Armour is Power Armour stripped from the corpses of Space Marines and re-purposed for use by the Orks."
 r_plasma_chompa:0 "Plasma Chompa"
 r_plasma_chompa_desc:0 "Modeled after one of the deadliest predators in the galaxy, this weapon is no less deadly than the standard Astartes Plasma Cannon. What makes it less deadly, obviously, is that the weapon sits in the hands of an Ork—though many a fool has found their life abruptly taking a turn for the worse by under estimating the Greenskins."
 r_powerrippa:0 "Power Rippa"
 r_powerrippa_desc:0 "When an Ork grabs a hold of a target with a Power Klaw, there’s little they can’t tear asunder. The Power Rippa differs from the standard Klaw, which specializes in crushing, by using hooks designed to rip and tear away flesh and chitinous hides (like those found on Tyranids.) The wicked looking hooks are as effective at striking terror into lightly armoured foes, as they are at tearing a target apart."
 r_sparekeys_combishoota:0 "Spare Keys Combishoota"
 r_sparekeys_combishoota_desc:0 "The Goffs on Arkhona answer to Luguk ‘Edpuncha, largest, and therefore most dangerous of an already brutal Ork Tribe. Well known for adorning his weapon in trinkets and trophies from those he defeats, his kombi-shoota is also equipped with rokkits, providing added vehicle penetration to an already deadly weapon. Those who follow him have been known to emulate his trinket obsession, decorating their weapons and armour with trophies from the fallen."
 r_splash_burna:0 "Splash Burna"
 r_splash_burna_desc:0 "The Burna is the basic Ork flame weapon, akin to an Imperial Flamer. Most burnas a little more than cans of fuel hooked up to a pump, they are devastating on a battlefield. Burnas are heavy-duty combination of cutting torch and flamethrower, switching between two functions with a simple twist of the spigot and altering the fuel pressure. This allows its user to slice through anything from personal armour to starship's hull, or incinerate enemies, using it as a normal flamer. It is often used in as a construction tool in creating Ork war machines, as well as a weapon."
 r_squig_armor:0 "Squig Armor"
 r_squig_armor_desc:0 "Squig Armour is a type of Ork armour made from the body of a Squig. It was first created when some enterprising Ork (or perhaps more accurately a Gretchin) took a Squig and dragged the creature over the head of an Ork. It’s unclear whether the creature survives this process (the gaping hole in its head would tend to indicate no), but the result is the same — an extra layer of protection that must be removed before the Greenskin wearing it can be slain."
 r_warbuggy:0 "Warbuggy"
 r_warbuggy_desc:0 "Though they come in all shapes and sizes, a standard Warbuggy has a 4 wheeled low-riding chassis and a supercharged engine that enables it to zoom into battle at incredible pace. As a result, Warbuggies are ideally suited for the ash wastes and silt flats of Industrial Worlds."

The term promethium also refers more specifically to the substance that is the 41st Millennium's equivalent of napalm, a highly volatile incendiary gel derived in part from refined hydrocarbons which immediately ignites on contact with oxygen and is used in Imperial Flamer Weapons to provide a lethal stream of fire. This form of promethium reaches super-hot temperatures. Similar to napalm, this gel sticks to an individual, continuing to burn on its own accord, even underwater and in the vacuum of space. If properly blessed, it can be used as the fuel for Incinerators, and thus is often used by the Imperial Inquisition's Ordo Malleus and Ordo Hereticus to purge their enemies, particularly daemonhosts and rogue psykers."

 planets.23.name:0 "§HPromethium Mine§!: [Root.GetName] Dug"
 planets.23.desc:0 "This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth, such as longwall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface. It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunneling (as would be the case for sand, cinder, and gravel). In contrast, minerals that have been found underground but are difficult to retrieve due to hard rock can be reached using a form of underground mining."

It is all steel now, miles in every direction.\n\nA place once molded by chance and the unthinking laws of nature, now a design wrought from indomitable purpose."
